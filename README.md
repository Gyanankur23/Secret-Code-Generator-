# 🔐 Secret Code Generator

Welcome to the **Secret Code Generator**!  
A simple and fun Python project that lets you **encode** and **decode messages** using a Caesar cipher technique.

Made with ❤️ by [Gyanankur Baruah](https://github.com/Gyanankur23)

## ✨ Features

- 🔁 Encode regular messages with a shift value
- 🔓 Decode coded messages back to the original
- 🆎 Supports both uppercase and lowercase letters
- ❌ Ignores punctuation, numbers, and special characters
- 🧠 Easy-to-understand logic and clean functions

---

## 🧰 Technologies Used

- 🐍 Python 3.x
- 📜 Simple console-based interaction
- 💡 String manipulation and functions

3. Run the Python file:



python Secretcode.py

4. Choose to encode or decode your message from the menu.

⚙️ How It Works

The program takes your input message and a shift number.

For encoding, each letter is shifted forward in the alphabet.

For decoding, each letter is shifted backward by the same amount.

The shift wraps around (e.g., Z → B with a shift of 2).

Non-alphabetic characters like spaces, punctuation, and digits are ignored.
